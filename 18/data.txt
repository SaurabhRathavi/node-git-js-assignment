First, we need to run the gitÂ reflog command, which displays all the recent actions with their hash value, including those that affected the deleted branch
We need to copy the commit hash of the deleted branch and create a new branch using the following command:
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <commit-hash>

Supposing I want the name of branch new-branch and the hash value of commit is 1bea043, then my command looks like
git checkout -b new-branch 1bea043

This will create a new branch with all the previous commits of the deleted branch
